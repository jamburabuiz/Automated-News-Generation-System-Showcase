**Installation**

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo-url>
   cd content-gen-app
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install  # or with Yarn
   yarn install
   ```

**Configuration**

Create a file named `.env` in the root directory to store environment variables (like the RSS feed URL). Here's an example:

```
RSS_FEED_URL=https://example.com/rss-feed
PORT=3000
```

Update the `RSS_FEED_URL` based on your chosen source.

2. **Access the API Endpoint:**

   Once running, retrieve JSON data from the RSS feed via:

   ```bash
   GET http://localhost:3000/api/rss
   ```

   This endpoint provides the converted JSON format.
